MY FIRST REPOSITORY Project is based on full stack Web development. In this project we have implemented html, css, javascript, Django. This website basically works on the concept of Question answer based solution.

HTML is abbreviated as Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

Django is an advanced Web framework written in Python that makes use of the model view controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

The main aim of the project is to solve the problems and clearing the doubts of the students based on the previously asked questions. This will help students and working professional to know about the solution to the commonly solved problem. The general solution to already asked question are found.
